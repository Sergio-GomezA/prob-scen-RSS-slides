	abstract = {Installed capacities of wind and solar power have grown rapidly over recent years, and the pool of literature on very short-term (minutes- to hours-ahead) wind and solar forecasting has grown in line with this. This paper reviews established and emerging approaches to provide an up-to-date view of the field. Knowledge transfer between wind and solar forecasting has benefited the field and is discussed, and new opportunities are identified, particularly regarding use of remote sensing technology. Forecasting methodologies and study design are compared and recommendations for high quality, reproducible results are presented. In particular, the choice of suitable benchmarks and use of sufficiently long datasets is highlighted. A case study of three distinct approaches to probabilistic wind power forecasting is presented using an open dataset. The case study provides an example of exemplary forecast evaluation, and open source code allows for its reproduction and use in future work.},

	abstract = {Ageing is a fact of life. Just as with conventional forms of power generation, the energy produced by a wind farm gradually decreases over its lifetime, perhaps due to falling availability, aerodynamic performance or conversion efficiency. Understanding these factors is however complicated by the highly variable availability of the wind. This paper reveals the rate of ageing of a national fleet of wind turbines using free public data for the actual and theoretical ideal load factors from the {UK}'s 282 wind farms. Actual load factors are recorded monthly for the period of 2002–2012, covering 1686 farm-years of operation. Ideal load factors are derived from a high resolution wind resource assessment made using {NASA} data to estimate the hourly wind speed at the location and hub height of each wind farm, accounting for the particular models of turbine installed. By accounting for individual site conditions we confirm that load factors do decline with age, at a similar rate to other rotating machinery. Wind turbines are found to lose 1.6 ± 0.2\% of their output per year, with average load factors declining from 28.5\% when new to 21\% at age 19. This trend is consistent for different generations of turbine design and individual wind farms. This level of degradation reduces a wind farm's output by 12\% over a twenty year lifetime, increasing the levelised cost of electricity by 9\%.},

The supply, demand and prices are becoming more volatile and less predictable than ever before. Even its business model is being challenged fundamentally. In this competitive and dynamic environment, many decision-making processes rely on probabilistic forecasts to quantify the uncertain future. Although most of the papers in the energy forecasting literature focus on point or single-valued forecasts, the research interest in probabilistic energy forecasting research has taken off rapidly in recent years. In this paper, we summarize the recent research progress on probabilistic energy forecasting. A major portion of the paper is devoted to introducing the Global Energy Forecasting Competition 2014 ({GEFCom}2014), a probabilistic energy forecasting competition with four tracks on load, price, wind and solar forecasting, which attracted 581 participants from 61 countries.

	abstract = {As a direct consequence of power systems restructuring on one hand and unprecedented renewable energy utilization on the other, the uncertainties of power systems are getting more and more attention. This fact intensifies the difficulty of decision making in the power system context; therefore, the uncertainty analysis of the system performance seems necessary. Generally, uncertainties in any engineering system study can be represented probabilistically or possibilistically. When sufficient historical data of the system variables is not available, a probability density function ({PDF}) might not be defined, they must be represented in another manner i.e. using possibilistic theory. When some of the system uncertain variables are probabilistic and some are possibilistic, neither the conventional pure probabilistic nor pure possibilistic methods can be implemented. Hence, a combined solution is needed. This paper gives a complete review on uncertainty modeling approaches for power system studies making sense about the strengths and weakness of these methods. This work may be used in order to select the most appropriate method for each application.},

Increased activity within model development in recent years has led to several new models and modelling capabilities, partly motivated by the need to better represent the integration of variable renewables. The purpose of this paper is to give an updated overview of currently available modelling tools, their capabilities and to serve as an aid for modellers in their process of identifying and choosing an appropriate model. A broad spectrum of modelling tools, ranging from small-scale power system analysis tools to global long-term energy models, has been assessed. Key information regarding the general logic, spatiotemporal resolution as well as the technological and economic features of the models is presented in three comprehensive tables. This information has been validated and updated by model developers or affiliated contact persons, and is state-of-the-art as of the submission date. With the available suite of modelling tools, most challenges of today's electricity system can be assessed. For a future with an increasing share of variable renewables and increasing electrification of the energy system, there are some challenges such as how to represent short-term variability in long-term studies, incorporate the effect of climate change and ensure openness and transparency in modelling studies.},

	abstract = {Renewable energy, such as hydro power, photovoltaics and wind turbines, has become the most widely applied solutions for addressing issues associated with oil depletion, increasing energy demand and anthropogenic global warming. Solar and wind energy are strongly dependent on weather resources with intermittent and fluctuating features. To filter these variabilities, battery energy storage systems have been broadly accepted as one of the potential solutions, with advantages such as fast response capability, sustained power delivery, and geographical independence. During the implementation of battery energy storage systems, one of the most crucial issues is to optimally determine the size of the battery for balancing the trade-off between the technical improvements brought by the battery and the additional overall cost. Numerous studies have been performed to optimise battery sizing for different renewable energy systems using a range of criteria and methods. This paper provides a comprehensive review of battery sizing criteria, methods and its applications in various renewable energy systems. The applications for storage systems have been categorised based on the specific renewable energy system that the battery storage will be a part. This is in contrast to previous studies where the battery sizing approaches were either arranged as an optimised component in renewable systems or only accounted for one category of renewable system. By taking this approach, it becomes clear that the critical metrics for battery sizing, and by extension the most suitable method for determining battery size, are determined by the type of renewable energy system application, as well as its size. This has important implications for the design process as the renewable energy system application will drive the battery energy storage system sizing methodology chosen.},

The world is transforming itself into an industrial and knowledge society from an agricultural one which in turn makes the growth, energy intensive resulting in emissions. Energy modeling and energy planning is vital for the future economic prosperity and environmental security. Soft computing techniques such as fuzzy logic, neural networks, genetic algorithms are being adopted in energy modeling to precisely map the energy systems. In this paper, an attempt has been made to review the applications of fuzzy logic based models in renewable energy systems namely solar, wind, bio-energy, micro-grid and hybrid applications. It is found that fuzzy based models are extensively used in recent years for site assessment, for installing of photovoltaic/wind farms, power point tracking in solar photovoltaic/wind, optimization among conflicting criteria. The review indicates that fuzzy based models provide realistic estimates.},

	abstract = {Creating noise from data is easy; creating data from noise is generative modeling. We present a stochastic differential equation ({SDE}) that smoothly transforms a complex data distribution to a known prior distribution by slowly injecting noise, and a corresponding reverse-time {SDE} that transforms the prior distribution back into the data distribution by slowly removing the noise. Crucially, the reverse-time {SDE} depends only on the time-dependent gradient field ({\textbackslash}aka, score) of the perturbed data distribution. By leveraging advances in score-based generative modeling, we can accurately estimate these scores with neural networks, and use numerical {SDE} solvers to generate samples. We show that this framework encapsulates previous approaches in score-based generative modeling and diffusion probabilistic modeling, allowing for new sampling procedures and new modeling capabilities. In particular, we introduce a predictor-corrector framework to correct errors in the evolution of the discretized reverse-time {SDE}. We also derive an equivalent neural {ODE} that samples from the same distribution as the {SDE}, but additionally enables exact likelihood computation, and improved sampling efficiency. In addition, we provide a new way to solve inverse problems with score-based models, as demonstrated with experiments on class-conditional generation, image inpainting, and colorization. Combined with multiple architectural improvements, we achieve record-breaking performance for unconditional image generation on {CIFAR}-10 with an Inception score of 9.89 and {FID} of 2.20, a competitive likelihood of 2.99 bits/dim, and demonstrate high fidelity generation of 1024 x 1024 images for the first time from a score-based generative model.},

	abstract = {With rapid increasing of wind power generating capacity, the influence of wind power on power system planning and operation becomes more and more severe. Wind power time series modeling is the basis of evaluating the influence accurately of wind power on power system, which is very important to annual wind power dispatch planning and installed capacity optimization. In this paper, a novel modeling method of wind power time series based on the definition and identification of the fluctuation process is proposed. The Gaussian function is proved to be a good choice to sketch the fluctuation process and the visualization self-organizing map clustering algorithm is used to classify the fluctuation process. The expected wind power time series is achieved by studying the statistical feature of the sample data and by analyzing the transfer characteristic of the fluctuation processes. The comparative analysis on the statistical feature of the generated time series and the sample data is presented. In terms of the 15 min and 1 h variation, autocorrelation function, monthly mean and hourly mean of the generated wind power, the proposed method in this paper are better than the commonly used Markov Chain Monte Carlo method. The proposed method can keep the variation and process characteristic of the wind power, which is very important for the study of stochastic planning and operation of the wind power in power system.},

	abstract = {Electricity demand in remote and island areas are generally supplied by diesel or other fossil fuel based generation systems. Nevertheless, due to the increasing cost and harmful emissions of fossil fuels there is a growing trend to use standalone hybrid renewable energy systems ({HRESs}). Due to the complementary characteristics, matured technologies and availability in most areas, hybrid systems with solar and wind energy have become the popular choice in such applications. However, the intermittency and high net present cost are the challenges associated with solar and wind energy systems. In this context, optimal sizing is a key factor to attain a reliable supply at a low cost through these standalone systems. Therefore, there has been a growing interest to develop algorithms for size optimization in standalone {HRESs}. The optimal sizing methodologies reported so far can be broadly categorized as classical algorithms, modern techniques and software tools. Modern techniques, based on single artificial intelligence ({AI}) algorithms, are becoming more popular than classical algorithms owing to their capabilities in solving complex optimization problems. Moreover, in recent years, there has been a clear trend to use hybrid algorithms over single algorithms mainly due to their ability to provide more promising optimization results. This paper aims to present a comprehensive review on recent developments in size optimization methodologies, as well as a critical comparison of single algorithms, hybrid algorithms, and software tools used for sizing standalone solar and wind {HRES}. In addition, an evaluation of all the possible combinations of standalone solar and wind energy systems, including their assessment parameters of economical, reliability, environmental, and social aspects, are also presented.},

The current development of cost-effective operation and maintenance methods for modern wind turbines benefits from the advancement of effective and accurate wind power forecasting approaches. This paper systematically reviewed the state-of-the-art approaches of wind power forecasting with regard to physical, statistical (time series and artificial neural networks) and hybrid methods, including factors that affect accuracy and computational time in the predictive modelling efforts. Besides, this study provided a guideline for wind power forecasting process screening, allowing the wind turbine/farm operators to identify the most appropriate predictive methods based on time horizons, input features, computational time, error measurements, etc. More specifically, further recommendations for the research community of wind power forecasting were proposed based on reviewed literature.},

	abstract = {The use of wind power, a pollution-free and renewable form of energy, to generate electricity has attracted increasing attention. However, intermittent electricity generation resulting from the random nature of wind speed poses challenges to the safety and stability of electric power grids when wind power is integrated into grids on large scales. Therefore, accurate forecasting of wind speed and wind power ({WS}/{WP}) has gradually taken on a key role in reducing wind power fluctuations in system dispatch planning. With the development of artificial intelligence technologies, especially deep learning, increasing numbers of deep learning-based models are being considered for {WS}/{WP} forecasting due to their superior ability to deal with complex nonlinear problems. This paper comprehensively reviews the various deep learning technologies being used in {WS}/{WP} forecasting, including the stages of data processing, feature extraction, and relationship learning. The forecasting performance of some popular models is tested and compared using two real-world wind datasets. In this review, three challenges to accurate {WS}/{WP} forecasting under complex conditions are identified, namely, data uncertainties, incomplete features, and intricate nonlinear relationships. Moreover, future research directions are summarized as a guide to improve the accuracy of {WS}/{WP} forecasts.},

Following a systematic method of literature review, we have established 4 research questions and 37 scientific articles that answer the said questions. Consequently, we found that artificial neural networks are used more frequently for the prediction of wind energy, which highlights its use in the studies consulted for the results achieved compared with that of other methods.},

	abstract = {Wind power generation differs from conventional thermal generation due to the stochastic nature of wind. Thus wind power forecasting plays a key role in dealing with the challenges of balancing supply and demand in any electricity system, given the uncertainty associated with the wind farm power output. Accurate wind power forecasting reduces the need for additional balancing energy and reserve power to integrate wind power. Wind power forecasting tools enable better dispatch, scheduling and unit commitment of thermal generators, hydro plant and energy storage plant and more competitive market trading as wind power ramps up and down on the grid. This paper presents an in-depth review of the current methods and advances in wind power forecasting and prediction. Firstly, numerical wind prediction methods from global to local scales, ensemble forecasting, upscaling and downscaling processes are discussed. Next the statistical and machine learning approach methods are detailed. Then the techniques used for benchmarking and uncertainty analysis of forecasts are overviewed, and the performance of various approaches over different forecast time horizons is examined.

Wind power has been a widely used source of green energy. However, the wind’s stochastic and unpredictable behavior has created several challenges to the operation and stability of energy systems. Forecasting models have been developed and excessively used in recent decades in order to deal with these challenges. Deterministic forecasting models have been the main focus of researchers and are still being developed in order to improve their accuracy. Furthermore, in recent years, in order to observe and study the uncertainty of forecasts, probabilistic forecasting models have been developed in order to give a wider view of the possible prediction outcomes. Advanced probabilistic and deterministic forecasting models could be used in order to facilitate the energy systems operation and energy markets management.

An accurate wind power forecasting is crucial to achieve a stable and reliable operation of the power grid. However, the unpredictability and stochastic characteristics of wind power affect the grid planning and operation adversely. To address these concerns, a substantial amount of research has been carried out to introduce an efficient wind power forecasting approach. Artificial Intelligence ({AI}) approaches have demonstrated high precision, better generalization performance and improved learning capability, thus can be ideal to handle unstable, inflexible and intermittent wind power. Recently, {AI}-based hybrid approaches have become popular due to their high precision, strong adaptability and improved performance. Thus, the goal of this review paper is to present the recent progress of {AI}-enabled hybrid approaches for wind power forecasting emphasizing classification, structure, strength, weakness and performance analysis. Moreover, this review explores the various influential factors toward the implementations of {AI}-based hybrid wind power forecasting including data preprocessing, feature selection, hyperparameters adjustment, training algorithm, activation functions and evaluation process. Besides, various key issues, challenges and difficulties are discussed to identify the existing limitations and research gaps. Finally, the review delivers a few selective future proposals that would be valuable to the industrialists and researchers to develop an advanced {AI}-based hybrid approach for accurate wind power forecasting toward sustainable grid operation.},

While forecasts are most often evaluated based on squared or absolute errors, these error measures do not always adequately reflect the loss functions and true expectations of the forecast user, neither do they provide enough information for the desired evaluation task. Over the last decade, research in forecast verification has intensified, and a number of verification frameworks and diagnostic tools have been proposed. However, the corresponding literature is generally very technical and most often dedicated to forecast model developers. This can make forecast users struggle to select the most appropriate verification tools for their application while not fully appraising subtleties related to their application and interpretation. This paper revisits the most common verification tools from a forecast user perspective and discusses their suitability for different application examples as well as evaluation setup design and significance of evaluation results.},

Detailed forecasts are necessary for the optimization of power systems of various sizes. This review and analytical paper is largely focused on a statistical analysis of forecasting errors based on more than one hundred papers on wind generation forecasts. Factors affecting the magnitude of forecasting errors are presented and discussed. Normalized root mean squared error ({nRMSE}) and normalized mean absolute error ({nMAE}) have been selected as the main error metrics considered here. A new and unique error dispersion factor ({EDF}) is proposed, being the ratio of {nRMSE} to {nMAE}. The variability of {EDF} depending on selected factors (size of wind farm, forecasting horizons, and class of forecasting method) has been examined. This is unique and original research, a novelty in studies on errors of power generation forecasts in wind farms. In addition, extensive quantitative and qualitative analyses have been conducted to assess the magnitude of forecasting error depending on selected factors (such as forecasting horizon, wind farm size, and a class of the forecasting method). Based on these analyses and a review of more than one hundred papers, a unique set of recommendations on the preferred content of papers addressing wind farm generation forecasts has been developed. These recommendations would make it possible to conduct very precise benchmarking meta-analyses of forecasting studies described in research papers and to develop valuable general conclusions concerning the analyzed phenomena.},

	abstract = {Many countries and regions are introducing policies aimed at reducing the environmental footprint from the energy sector and increasing the use of renewable energy. In the United States, a number of initiatives have been taken at the state level, from renewable portfolio standards ({RPSs}) and renewable energy certificates ({RECs}), to regional greenhouse gas emission control schemes. Within the U.S. Federal government, new energy and environmental policies and goals are also being crafted, and these are likely to increase the use of renewable energy substantially. The European Union is pursuing implementation of its ambitious 20/20/20 targets, which aim (by 2020) to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 20\% (as compared to 1990), increase the amount of renewable energy to 20\% of the energy supply, and reduce the overall energy consumption by 20\% through energy efficiency. With the current focus on energy and the environment, efficient integration of renewable energy into the electric power system is becoming increasingly important. In a recent report, the U.S. Department of Energy ({DOE}) describes a model-based scenario, in which wind energy provides 20\% of the U.S. electricity demand in 2030. The report discusses a set of technical and economic challenges that have to be overcome for this scenario to unfold. In Europe, several countries already have a high penetration of wind power (i.e., in the range of 7 to 20\% of electricity consumption in countries such as Germany, Spain, Portugal, and Denmark). The rapid growth in installed wind power capacity is expected to continue in the United States as well as in Europe. A large-scale introduction of wind power causes a number of challenges for electricity market and power system operators who will have to deal with the variability and uncertainty in wind power generation when making their scheduling and dispatch decisions. Wind power forecasting ({WPF}) is frequently identified as an important tool to address the variability and uncertainty in wind power and to more efficiently operate power systems with large wind power penetrations. Moreover, in a market environment, the wind power contribution to the generation portofolio becomes important in determining the daily and hourly prices, as variations in the estimated wind power will influence the clearing prices for both energy and operating reserves. With the increasing penetration of wind power, {WPF} is quickly becoming an important topic for the electric power industry. System operators ({SOs}), generating companies ({GENCOs}), and regulators all support efforts to develop better, more reliable and accurate forecasting models. Wind farm owners and operators also benefit from better wind power prediction to support competitive participation in electricity markets against more stable and dispatchable energy sources. In general, {WPF} can be used for a number of purposes, such as: generation and transmission maintenance planning, determination of operating reserve requirements, unit commitment, economic dispatch, energy storage optimization (e.g., pumped hydro storage), and energy trading. The objective of this report is to review and analyze state-of-the-art {WPF} models and their application to power systems operations. We first give a detailed description of the methodologies underlying state-of-the-art {WPF} models. We then look at how {WPF} can be integrated into power system operations, with specific focus on the unit commitment problem.},

Because wind power is weather dependent, it is variable and intermittent over various time-scales. Thus accurate forecasting of wind power is recognized as a major contribution for reliable large-scale wind power integration. Wind power forecasting methods can be used to plan unit commitment, scheduling and dispatch by system operators, and maximize profit by electricity traders. In addition, a number of wind power models have been developed internationally, such as {WPMS}, {WPPT}, Prediktor, {ARMINES}, Previento, {WPFS} Ver1.0 etc. This paper provides a review on comparative analysis on the foremost forecasting models, associated with wind speed and power, based on physical methods, statistical methods, hybrid methods over different time-scales. Furthermore, this paper gives emphasis on the accuracy of these models and the source of major errors, thus problems and challenges associated with wind power prediction are presented.},

Accurate forecasts of wind generation are therefore paramount for reducing such penalties and thus maximizing revenue. Despite the fact that increasing accuracy in spot forecasts may reduce penalties, this paper shows that, if such forecasts are accompanied with information on their uncertainty, i.e., in the form of predictive distributions, then this can be the basis for defining advanced strategies for market participation. Such strategies permit to further increase revenues and thus enhance competitiveness of wind generation compared to other forms of dispatchable generation. This paper formulates a general methodology for deriving optimal bidding strategies based on probabilistic forecasts of wind generation, as well as on modeling of the sensitivity a wind power producer may have to regulation costs. The benefits resulting from the application of these strategies are clearly demonstrated on the test case of the participation of a multi-{MW} wind farm in the Dutch electricity market over a year.},

	abstract = {Of the various renewable energy resources, wind power is widely recognized as one of the most promising. The management of wind farms and electricity systems can benefit greatly from the availability of estimates of the probability distribution of wind power generation. However, most research has focused on point forecasting of wind power. In this article, we develop an approach to producing density forecasts for the wind power generated at individual wind farms. Our interest is in intraday data and prediction from 1 to 72 hours ahead. We model wind power in terms of wind speed and wind direction. In this framework, there are two key uncertainties. First, there is the inherent uncertainty in wind speed and direction, and we model this using a bivariate vector autoregressive moving average-generalized autoregressive conditional heteroscedastic ({VARMA}-{GARCH}) model, with a Student t error distribution, in the Cartesian space of wind speed and direction. Second, there is the stochastic nature of the relationship of wind power to wind speed (described by the power curve), and to wind direction. We model this using conditional kernel density ({CKD}) estimation, which enables a nonparametric modeling of the conditional density of wind power. Using Monte Carlo simulation of the {VARMA}-{GARCH} model and {CKD} estimation, density forecasts of wind speed and direction are converted to wind power density forecasts. Our work is novel in several respects: previous wind power studies have not modeled a stochastic power curve; to accommodate time evolution in the power curve, we incorporate a time decay factor within the {CKD} method; and the {CKD} method is conditional on a density, rather than a single value. The new approach is evaluated using datasets from four Greek wind farms.},

	abstract = {This paper shows a novel method to characterize wind turbine power performance directly from high-frequency fluctuating measurements. In particular, we show how to evaluate the dynamic response of the wind turbine system on fluctuating wind speed in the range of seconds. The method is based on the stochastic differential equations known as the Langevin equations of diffusive Markov processes. Thus, the fluctuating wind turbine power output is decomposed into two functions: (i) the relaxation, which describes the deterministic dynamic response of the wind turbine to its desired operation state, and (ii) the stochastic force (noise), which is an intrinsic feature of the system of wind power conversion. As a main result, we show that independently of the turbulence intensity of the wind, the characteristic of the wind turbine power performance is properly reconstructed. This characteristic is given by their fixed points (steady states) from the deterministic dynamic relaxation conditioned for given wind speed values. The method to estimate these coefficients directly from the data is presented and applied to numerical model data, as well as to real-world measured power output data. The method is universal and is not only more accurate than the current standard procedure of ensemble averaging ({IEC}-61400-12) but it also allows a faster and robust estimation of wind turbines' power curves.

	abstract = {A frequent challenge for wind energy applications is to grasp the impacts of turbulent wind fields properly. The wind turbine power performance curve, usually determined applying the {IEC} standard 61400-12, provides a functional relation between the measured wind speed u and the corresponding power output P of the turbine. But it is not sufficient to describe the actual dynamics of the power output on small time scales. Recently, we introduced an alternative method to estimate the power curve of a wind turbine based on high-frequency data. The crucial point of this method is that we first reconstruct the wind turbine's entire response dynamics that, then, yields the power curve by a fixed-point analysis. To reconstruct the power conversion dynamics of the wind turbine, we apply a dynamical systems approach, assuming that the variable P(t) follows a diffusion process. Its evolution in time is given by a Langevin equation consisting of a deterministic relaxation term and a stochastic noise term. The coefficients defininig these terms can directly be extracted from the given data sets. On the basis of simulated data, we verified the method and showed that it is more accurate than the standard method. For measured data we reconstructed the deterministic dynamics of a representative wind turbine and estimated the corresponding power characteristics to demonstrate the application of the method. The split of the dynamics into a deterministic and a stochastic part allows to distinguish the actual behaviour of the wind turbine, i.e. relaxation and control effects, from the turbulent effects of the wind. We gain an understanding of something like the turbulent dynamics of wind energy conversion and obtain a method to describe the actual fluctuations in power output.},

A proposal is formulated and evaluated here for the case of solar power generation, when only power and meteorological measurements are available, without sky-imaging and information about cloud passages. Our empirical investigation reveals that the distribution of forecast errors do not follow any of the common parametric densities. This therefore motivates the proposal of a nonparametric approach to generate very short-term predictive densities, i.e., for lead times between a few minutes to one hour ahead, with fast frequency updates. We rely on an Extreme Learning Machine ({ELM}) as a fast regression model, trained in varied ways to obtain both point and quantile forecasts of solar power generation. Four probabilistic methods are implemented as benchmarks. Rival approaches are evaluated based on a number of test cases for two solar power generation sites in different climatic regions, allowing us to show that our approach results in generation of skilful and reliable probabilistic forecasts in a computationally efficient manner.},

It helps to improve the reliability and reduces the generation cost. Advances in computer technology and sensors make the numeric modeling methods a hotspot in the field of {PV} power forecasting. However, data modeling methods strongly rely on the accuracy of measurement data. Unavoidable outliers in the measured meteorological data have an adverse effect on the model due to their heteroscedasticity. Although many studies can be found focusing on outlier detection, only a few have incorporated outlier detection with regression models. In this study, an innovative method employing the weighted Gaussian process regression approach is proposed, such that data samples with higher outlier potential have a low weight. A density-based local outlier detection approach is introduced to compensate the deterioration of Euclidean distance for high-dimensional data. A novel concept of the degree of nonlinear correlation is incorporated to compute the contribution of every individual data attribute. Effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated by performing an experimental analysis and making comparisons with other typical data-based approaches, and the results exhibit higher estimation accuracy.},

	abstract = {Wind power curves play important roles in wind power forecasting, wind turbine condition monitoring, estimation of wind energy potential and wind turbine selection. In practice, it is a challenging task to produce reliable wind power curves from raw wind data due to the presence of outliers formed in unexpected conditions, e.g., wind curtailment and blade damage. This paper comprehensively reviews wind power curve modeling techniques from the perspective of modeling processes, i.e., wind data analyses, wind data preprocessing and various wind power curve models. Moreover, the performances of many popular power curve models are studied in different seasons and different wind farms. The results show that no universal wind power curve model can always perform better than other models under any environmental conditions. In general, there are three factors that affect the final wind power curves: data filtering approaches; wind power curve models; and choice of optimization strategies (especially the method applied to construct objective functions). However, there is no guarantee that all outliers will be removed from the raw wind data. Consequently, designing robust regression models or constructing robust objective functions may be two effective ways to obtain accurate power curves in the presence of outliers. The above two strategies depend largely on the error characteristics of power curve modeling. While it is often observed that the error distribution of the power curve modeling may be asymmetric, few researchers have considered this trait when building wind power curves. Therefore, this paper proposes several strategies that focus on designing asymmetric loss functions and developing robust regression models with asymmetric error distributions. Models that benefit from these characteristics may be more suitable for power curve modeling tasks and are more likely to produce better wind power curves.},

	abstract = {In recent years, the penetration of photovoltaic ({PV}) generation in the energy mix of several countries has significantly increased thanks to policies favoring development of renewables and also to the significant cost reduction of this specific technology. The {PV} power production process is characterized by significant variability, as it depends on meteorological conditions, which brings new challenges to power system operators. To address these challenges, it is important to be able to observe and anticipate production levels. Accurate forecasting of the power output of {PV} plants is recognized today as a prerequisite for large-scale {PV} penetration on the grid. In this paper, we propose a statistical method to address the problem of stationarity of {PV} production data, and develop a model to forecast {PV} plant power output in the very short term (0-6 h). The proposed model uses distributed power plants as sensors and exploits their spatio-temporal dependencies to improve forecasts. The computational requirements of the method are low, making it appropriate for large-scale application and easy to use when online updating of the production data is possible. The improvement of the normalized root mean square error ({nRMSE}) can reach 20\% or more in comparison with state-of-the-art forecasting techniques.},

This variability presents technical and financial challenges for {RES} integration into grids and electricity markets. To address these challenges, it is important to accurately predict the future amount of energy production. In this paper we propose a spot statistical forecasting model for very short-term horizons (from a few minutes up to six hours ahead). This model is based on a combination of heterogeneous inputs with a conditioned learning approach. Spatio-temporal inputs (measurements from geographically distributed {PV} sites and satellite images) are used to enhance short-term predictability, while a weather analog approach enables adaptability to changes in meteorological conditions by considering the most relevant past observations. The performance evaluations are carried out on a case study featuring nine {PV} plants located in France, over a one-year period.},

	abstract = {Uncertainty in the upcoming production of photovoltaic ({PV}) plants is a challenge for grid operations and also a source of revenue loss for {PV} plant operators participating in electricity markets, since they have to pay penalties for the mismatch between contracted and actual productions. Improving {PV} predictability is an area of intense research. In real-world applications, forecasts are often needed for different time frames (horizon, update frequency, etc.) and are derived by dedicated models for each time frame (i.e., for day ahead and for intra-day trading). This can result in both different forecasted values corresponding to the same horizon and discontinuities among time-frames. In this paper we address this problem by proposing a novel seamless probabilistic forecasting approach able to cover multiple time frames. It is based on the Analog Ensemble ({AnEn}) model, however it is adapted to consider the most appropriate input for each horizon from a pool of available input data. It is designed to be able to start at any time of day, for any forecast horizon, making it well-suited for applications like continuous trading. It is easy to maintain as it adapts to the latest data and does not need regular retraining. We enhance short-term predictability by considering data from satellite images and in situ measurements. The proposed model has low complexity compared to benchmark models and is trivially parallelizable. It achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art models developed specifically for the short term (i.e., up to 6 hours) and the day ahead. The evaluation was carried out on a real-world case comprising three {PV} plants in France, over a period of one year.},

	abstract = {Photovoltaic ({PV}) solar power generation is always associated with uncertainties due to solar irradiance and other weather parameters intermittency. This creates a huge barrier in integrating solar power into the grid and biases power industries against deploying {PV} systems. Thus accurate short-term forecasts are important to efficiently integrate {PV} systems into the grid. This paper proposes a hybrid forecasting model combining wavelet transform, particle swarm optimization and support vector machine (Hybrid {WT}-{PSO}-{SVM}) for short-term (one-day-ahead) generation power forecasting of a real microgrid {PV} system. The model is developed by incorporating the interactions of the {PV} system Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition ({SCADA}) actual power record with Numerical Weather Prediction ({NWP}) meteorological data for one year with a time-step of 1 h. In the proposed model, the wavelet is employed to have a considerable impact on ill-behaved meteorological and {SCADA} data, and {SVM} techniques map the {NWP} meteorological variables and {SCADA} solar power nonlinear relationship in a better way. The {PSO} is used to optimize the parameters of the {SVM} to achieve a higher forecasting accuracy. The forecasting accuracy of the proposed model has been compared with other seven forecasting strategies and reveals outperformed performance with respect to forecasting accuracy improvement.},

A proposal is formulated and evaluated here for the case of solar power generation, when only power and meteorological measurements are available, without sky-imaging and information about cloud passages. Our empirical investigation reveals that the distribution of forecast errors do not follow any of the common parametric densities. This therefore motivates the proposal of a nonparametric approach to generate very short-term predictive densities, i.e., for lead times between a few minutes to one hour ahead, with fast frequency updates. We rely on an Extreme Learning Machine ({ELM}) as a fast regression model, trained in varied ways to obtain both point and quantile forecasts of solar power generation. Four probabilistic methods are implemented as benchmarks. Rival approaches are evaluated based on a number of test cases for two solar power generation sites in different climatic regions, allowing us to show that our approach results in generation of skilful and reliable probabilistic forecasts in a computationally efficient manner.},

A comprehensive comparison among data-driven forecasting models is performed using 30-min averaged data of recent two years. Moreover, benchmarking models including scaled persistence model, autoregressive model, and autoregressive exogenous model are employed to further validate the effectiveness of data-driven forecasting models.

In this paper, a model that can perform short-term forecasting of solar irradiance in any general location without the need of ground measurements is proposed. To do so, the model considers satellite-based measurements and weather-based forecasts, and employs a deep neural network structure that is able to generalize across locations; particularly, the network is trained only using a small subset of sites where ground data is available, and the model is able to generalize to a much larger number of locations where ground data does not exist. As a case study, 25 locations in The Netherlands are considered and the proposed model is compared against four local models that are individually trained for each location using ground measurements. Despite the general nature of the model, it is shown show that the proposed model is equal or better than the local models: when comparing the average performance across all the locations and prediction horizons, the proposed model obtains a 31.31\% {rRMSE} (relative root mean square error) while the best local model achieves a 32.01\% {rRMSE}.},

	abstract = {Wind speed forecasting plays an important role in estimating the power produced from wind farms. However, because of the non-linear and non-stationary characteristics of the wind speed time series, it is difficult to model and predict such series precisely by traditional wind speed forecasting models. In this paper, a novel hybrid modelling method is proposed, in which time series decomposition, feature selection, and basic forecasting model are combined in a synchronous optimisation framework. In this method, the above-mentioned modelling factors, which affect model performance, could make a concerted effort to improve the model. Specifically, variational mode decomposition, the Gram–Schmidt orthogonal, and extreme learning machine, are optimized synchronously by gravitational search algorithm in the proposed hybrid short-term wind speed forecasting model. First, variational mode decomposition is employed to decompose the original wind speed time series into a set of modes and into one bias series. Subsequently, the Gram–Schmidt orthogonal is used to select the important features. Next, the set of modes are forecasted using the {ELM}. Finally, the key parameters of the models in three stages are optimized synchronously by gravitational search algorithm. Seven data sets from the Sotavento Galicia wind farm and two wind farms in China have been adopted to evaluate the proposed method. The results show that the proposed method achieves significantly better performance than the traditional signal forecasting models both on one-step and multi-step wind speed forecasting with at least 40\% average performance promotion over all the seven competitors.},

However, it is facing some increasing difficulties to handle the large-scale dataset generated in these forecasting applications, with the purpose of ensuring stable computing performance. In response to such limitation, this paper proposes a more practical approach through the combination of extreme-learning machine ({ELM}) method and deep-learning model. {ELM} is a novel computing paradigm that enables the neural network ({NN}) based learning to be achieved with fast training speed and good generalization performance. The stacked {ELM} ({SELM}) is an advanced {ELM} algorithm under deep-learning framework, which works efficiently on memory consumption decrease. In this paper, an enhanced {SELM} is accordingly developed via replacing the Euclidean norm of the mean square error ({MSE}) criterion in {ELM} with the generalized correntropy criterion to further improve the forecasting performance. The advantage of the enhanced {SELM} with generalized correntropy to achieve better forecasting performance mainly relies on the following aspect. Generalized correntropy is a stable and robust nonlinear similarity measure while employing machine learning method to forecast wind speed, where the outliers may exist in some industrially measured values. Specifically, the experimental results of short-term and ultra-short-term forecasting on real wind speed data show that the proposed approach can achieve better computing performance compared with other traditional and more recent methods.},

This hybrid model presents an efficient and effective short term solar irradiation prediction approach using the historical solar irradiation data. The original non-stationary time series data is decomposed into various modes using {VMD} approach. The proposed {VMD}-{RMWK} ({VMD} based reduced Morlet Wavelet Kernel extreme learning machine) method is used to predict the solar irradiation of an experimental 1 {MW} solar power plant in Odisha, India. Different time intervals of 15 min, 1 h and 1 day ahead in different weather conditions are considered for forecasting purpose. The {VMD} technique decomposes the original nonlinear irradiation into a set of Variational Mode Functions ({VMFs}), and the extracted {VMFs} are used to train the kernel based robust {ELM}. Comparison with empirical mode decomposition ({EMD}) based low rank kernel is also presented in this paper. As a new contribution to the previously performed literature survey this paper presents a more accurate solar irradiation prediction paradigm for distinctive weather conditions, and different time intervals varying from very short duration of 15 min to one day ahead. Also to improve the reliability of the {KELM} and to make it robust under noisy conditions and the presence of outliers in the data, a weight loss matrix has been derived using a non-parametric kernel density estimation method and incorporated in the new formulation ({RKELM}). A typical solar power experimental solar power station in India has been taken for detailed study showing clearly the accuracy and robustness of the proposed approach. For cross validation of the proposed model, solar irradiation data from a solar power plant located in the state of Florida has been implemented.},

	abstract = {We consider the task of forecasting the electricity power generated by a solar {PhotoVoltaic} ({PV}) system for forecasting horizons from 5 to 60min ahead, from previous {PV} power and meteorological data. We present a new method based on advanced machine learning algorithms for variable selection and prediction. The correlation based variable selection identifies a small set of informative variables that are used as inputs for an ensemble of neural networks and support vector regression algorithms to generate the predictions. We develop two types of models: univariate, that use only previous {PV} power data, and multivariate, that also use previous weather data, and evaluate their performance on Australian {PV} data for two years. The results show that the univariate models performed similarly to the multivariate models, achieving mean relative error of 4.15–9.34\%. Hence, the {PV} power output for very short-term forecasting horizons of 5–60min can be predicted accurately by using only previous {PV} power data, without weather information. The most accurate model was univariate ensemble of neural networks, predicting the {PV} power output separately for each step of the forecasting horizon.},

	abstract = {Clouds are the dominant source of small-scale variability in surface solar radiation and uncertainty in its prediction. However, the increasing share of solar energy in the worldwide electric power supply increases the need for accurate solar radiation forecasts. 

 In this work, we present results of a very short term global horizontal irradiance ({GHI}) forecast experiment based on hemispheric sky images. A 2-month data set with images from one sky imager and high-resolution {GHI} measurements from 99 pyranometers distributed over 10 km by 12 km is used for validation. We developed a multi-step model and processed {GHI} forecasts up to 25 min with an update interval of 15 s. A cloud type classification is used to separate the time series into different cloud scenarios. 

 Overall, the sky-imager-based forecasts do not outperform the reference persistence forecasts. Nevertheless, we find that analysis and forecast performance depends strongly on the predominant cloud conditions. Especially convective type clouds lead to high temporal and spatial {GHI} variability. For cumulus cloud conditions, the analysis error is found to be lower than that introduced by a single pyranometer if it is used representatively for the whole area in distances from the camera larger than 1\&ndash;2 km. Moreover, forecast skill is much higher for these conditions compared to overcast or clear sky situations causing low {GHI} variability, which is easier to predict by persistence. In order to generalize the cloud-induced forecast error, we identify a variability threshold indicating conditions with positive forecast skill.},

	abstract = {Photovoltaic ({PV}) power is volatile in nature and raises the level of uncertainty in power systems. {PV} power forecasting is an important measure to solve this problem. It helps to improve the reliability and reduces the generation cost. Advances in computer technology and sensors make the numeric modeling methods a hotspot in the field of {PV} power forecasting. However, data modeling methods strongly rely on the accuracy of measurement data. Unavoidable outliers in the measured meteorological data have an adverse effect on the model due to their heteroscedasticity. Although many studies can be found focusing on outlier detection, only a few have incorporated outlier detection with regression models. In this study, an innovative method employing the weighted Gaussian process regression approach is proposed, such that data samples with higher outlier potential have a low weight. A density-based local outlier detection approach is introduced to compensate the deterioration of Euclidean distance for high-dimensional data. A novel concept of the degree of nonlinear correlation is incorporated to compute the contribution of every individual data attribute. Effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated by performing an experimental analysis and making comparisons with other typical data-based approaches, and the results exhibit higher estimation accuracy.},

	abstract = {Lack of predictability of solar power remains one major hindrance to the introduction of large-scale solar energy production. Comprehensive solar forecasting technologies are required to manage the intermittent nature of solar energy supply. However, one of the most challenging aspects of solar forecasting is the requirement for very short-term forecasting (in terms of minutes ahead) due to cloud movement, ambient temperature variation and humidity levels, which result in rapid ramp up and ramp down rates. This paper proposes an improved solar forecasting algorithm based on artificial neural network ({ANN}) model with fuzzy logic pre-processing. A three-layer (input layer, hidden layer and output layer) feed forward with back-propagation model is proposed as the neural network training algorithm. In this paper, an error correction factor based on the previous 5-min forecasted output is included to the input layer to minimize the forecast error. This is expected to produce a more accurate forecast. Weather information is a key input for the {ANN} model. In the case of rapid changes in solar irradiation or temperature on the forecast day, produced solar power changes greatly and forecast error would sensibly increase. In traditional prediction methods, the {ANN} uses all similar days’ data to learn the trend of similarity. However, learning all similar days’ data is quite complex, and it does not help if weather conditions change suddenly during the same day. Therefore, it is necessary to integrate into the {ANN}, a pre-processing stage that could perform real time analysis of weather information and factor it into the forecasting output. A fuzzy pre-processing toolbox is introduced into the proposed {ANN} model to find data correlation between cloud cover, temperature, wind speed, and wind direction with irradiance value. The accuracy of the proposed forecasting algorithm is compared with other {ANN} forecast algorithms.},

Therefore, the forecast of photovoltaic power generation is very crucial. In this paper, entropy method and extreme learning machine ({ELM}) method were combined to forecast a short-term photovoltaic power generation. First, entropy method is used to process initial data, train the network through the data after unification, and then forecast electricity generation. Finally, the data results obtained through the entropy method with {ELM} were compared with that generated through generalized regression neural network ({GRNN}) and radial basis function neural network ({RBF}) method.

	abstract = {Irradiance received on the earth’s surface is the main factor that affects the output power of solar {PV} plants, and is chiefly determined by the cloud distribution seen in a ground-based sky image at the corresponding moment in time. It is the foundation for those linear extrapolation-based ultra-short-term solar {PV} power forecasting approaches to obtain the cloud distribution in future sky images from the accurate calculation of cloud motion displacement vectors ({CMDVs}) by using historical sky images. Theoretically, the {CMDV} can be obtained from the coordinate of the peak pulse calculated from a Fourier phase correlation theory ({FPCT}) method through the frequency domain information of sky images. The peak pulse is significant and unique only when the cloud deformation between two consecutive sky images is slight enough, which is likely possible for a very short time interval (such as 1 min or shorter) with common changes in the speed of cloud. Sometimes, there will be more than one pulse with similar values when the deformation of the clouds between two consecutive sky images is comparatively obvious under fast changing cloud speeds. This would probably lead to significant errors if the {CMDVs} were still only obtained from the single coordinate of the peak value pulse. However, the deformation estimation of clouds between two images and its influence on {FPCT}-based {CMDV} calculations are terrifically complex and difficult because the motion of clouds is complicated to describe and model. Therefore, to improve the accuracy and reliability under these circumstances in a simple manner, an image-phase-shift-invariance ({IPSI}) based {CMDV} calculation method using {FPCT} is proposed for minute time scale solar power forecasting. First, multiple different {CMDVs} are calculated from the corresponding consecutive images pairs obtained through different synchronous rotation angles compared to the original images by using the {FPCT} method. Second, the final {CMDV} is generated from all of the calculated {CMDVs} through a centroid iteration strategy based on its density and distance distribution. Third, the influence of different rotation angle resolution on the final {CMDV} is analyzed as a means of parameter estimation. Simulations under various scenarios including both thick and thin clouds conditions indicated that the proposed {IPSI}-based {CMDV} calculation method using {FPCT} is more accurate and reliable than the original {FPCT} method, optimal flow ({OF}) method, and particle image velocimetry ({PIV}) method.},

Statistical methods such as Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average ({ARIMA}) and hybrid methods such as Wavelet Transform ({WT}) based {ARIMA} ({WT}-{ARIMA}) model have been the popular techniques in recent times for short-term and very short-term forecasting of wind speed. However, the contribution of the forecasting error due to different decomposed time series on the resultant wind speed forecasting error has yet not been analyzed. This paper, thus explores this shortcoming of the {ARIMA} and {WT}-{ARIMA} models in forecasting of wind speed and proposes a new Repeated {WT} based {ARIMA} ({RWT}-{ARIMA}) model, which has improved accuracy for very short-term wind speed forecasting. A comparison of the proposed {RWT}-{ARIMA} model with the benchmark persistence model for very short-term wind speed forecasting, {ARIMA} model and {WT}-{ARIMA} model has been done for various time-scales of forecasting such as 1min, 3min, 5min, 7min and 10min. This comparison proves the superiority of the proposed {RWT}-{ARIMA} model over other models in very short-term wind speed forecasting.},

However, the uncertainties due to the intermittent nature of wind energy make it difficult to operate electrical power systems optimally and make decisions that satisfy the needs of all the stakeholders of the electricity energy market. Thus, there is increasing interest determining how to forecast wind power production accurately. Most the methods that have been published in the relevant literature provided deterministic forecasts even though great interest has been focused recently on probabilistic forecast methods.  In this paper, an advanced probabilistic method is proposed for short-term forecasting of wind power production. A mixture of two Weibull distributions was used as a probability function to model the uncertainties associated with wind speed. Then, a Bayesian inference approach with a particularly-effective, autoregressive, integrated, moving-average model was used to determine the parameters of the mixture Weibull distribution. Numerical applications also are presented to provide evidence of the forecasting performance of the Bayesian-based approach.},

Statistical methods for wind speed forecasting based on recent observations outperform numerical weather prediction for forecast horizons up to a few hours, and the spatio-temporal interdependency between geographically dispersed locations may be exploited to improve forecast skill. Here, we show that conditioning spatio-temporal interdependency on “atmospheric modes” derived from gridded numerical weather data can further improve forecast performance. Atmospheric modes are based on the clustering of surface wind and sea-level pressure fields, and the geopotential height field at the 5000-{hPa} level. The data fields are extracted from the {MERRA}-2 reanalysis dataset with an hourly temporal resolution over the {UK}; atmospheric patterns are clustered using self-organising maps and then grouped further to optimise forecast performance. In a case study based on 6 years of measurements from 23 weather stations in the {UK}, a set of 3 atmospheric modes are found to be optimal for forecast performance. The skill of 1- to 6-hour-ahead forecasts is improved at all sites compared with persistence and competitive benchmarks. Across the 23 test sites, 1-hour-ahead root mean squared error is reduced by between 0.3\% and 4.1\% compared with the best performing benchmark and by an average of 1.6\% over all sites; the 6-hour-ahead accuracy is improved by an average of 3.1\%.},

Thus, it is necessary to implement appropriate methods to forecast wind power accurately. This paper proposes a novel model of wind power forecasting using random forest technique. For investigating the effectiveness of this model, the comparison was made with two methods namely support vector regression and Decision tree. For training and testing of this model Kolkata region data of wind power and meteorological data is used. The result shows that Random Forest and Decision Tree techniques provide better forecasting accuracy with lesser {MAPE}.

Then predictions of {LSTMs} are aggregated into a nonlinear-learning regression top-layer composed of {SVRM} and the {EO} is introduced to optimize the parameters of the top-layer. Lastly, the final ensemble prediction for wind speed is given by the fine-turning top-layer. The proposed {EnsemLSTM} is applied on two case studies data collected from a wind farm in Inner Mongolia, China, to perform ten-minute ahead utmost short term wind speed forecasting and one-hour ahead short term wind speed forecasting. Statistical tests of experimental results compared with other popular prediction models demonstrated the proposed {EnsemLSTM} can achieve a better forecasting performance.},

	abstract = {A spatio-temporal method for producing very-short-term parametric probabilistic wind power forecasts at a large number of locations is presented. Smart grids containing tens, or hundreds, of wind generators require skilled very-short-term forecasts to operate effectively and spatial information is highly desirable. In addition, probabilistic forecasts are widely regarded as necessary for optimal power system management as they quantify the uncertainty associated with point forecasts. Here, we work within a parametric framework based on the logit-normal distribution and forecast its parameters. The location parameter for multiple wind farms is modeled as a vector-valued spatio-temporal process and the scale parameter is tracked by modified exponential smoothing. A state-of-the-art technique for fitting sparse vector autoregressive models is employed to model the location parameter and demonstrates numerical advantages over conventional vector autoregressive models. The proposed method is tested on a dataset of 5 min mean wind power generation at 22 wind farms in Australia. Five-min ahead forecasts are produced and evaluated in terms of point, and probabilistic forecast skill scores and calibration. Conventional autoregressive and vector autoregressive models serve as benchmarks.},

However, most prior articles only attach importance to improving the accuracy or stability, few of them focus on the accuracy and stability, simultaneously. Therefore, considering one criterion i.e. accuracy or stability is insufficient, in this study a novel powerful hybrid forecasting system is successfully developed, which contains four modules: data preprocessing module, optimization module, forecasting module and evaluation module. In this system, decomposing algorithm is applied to divide the original wind speed data into a finite set of components. Moreover, to achieve high accuracy and strong stability simultaneously, multi-objective ant lion optimization is employed to optimize the initial weights between layers and thresholds of the Elman neutral network in the optimization module, which overcomes the drawbacks of single-objective optimization algorithms. Finally, evaluation module including hypothesis testing and evaluation criteria is introduced to make a comprehensive evaluation for this system. The experimental results indicate that the average values of the mean absolute percent errors of the developed model utilizing 10-min, 30-min and 60-min interval data are 2.8220\%, 5.0216\% and 7.7205\%, respectively, which are much lower than those of the comparison models.},

However, due to the high volatility and intermittency, it is difficult to model and predict wind power series through traditional forecasting approaches. To enhance prediction accuracy, this study developed a hybrid model that incorporates the following stages. First, an improved complete ensemble empirical mode decomposition with adaptive noise technology was applied to decompose the wind energy series for eliminating noise and extracting the main features of original data. Next, to achieve high accurate and stable forecasts, an improved wavelet neural network optimized by optimization methods was built and used to implement wind energy prediction. Finally, hypothesis testing, stability test and four case studies including eighteen comparison models were utilized to test the abilities of prediction models.

Here we discuss the performances of downscaling approaches using information from Numerical Weather Prediction ({NWP}) models, rarely used at those time scales, and compare them with the statistical approaches for the wind speed forecasting at hub height. The aim is to determine the added value of Model Output Statistics for sub-hourly forecasts of wind speed, compared to the classical time series based methods. Two downscaling approaches are tested: one using explanatory variables from {NWP} model outputs only and another which additionally includes local wind speed measurements. Results of both approaches and of the classical time series based methods, tested against persistence on a specific wind farm, are considered. For both hourly and sub-hourly forecasts, adding explanatory variables derived from observations in the downscaling models gives higher improvements over persistence than the benchmark methods and than the downscaling models using only the {NWP} model outputs.},

	abstract = {The unprecedented scale and sophistication of wind turbine technologies call for wind forecasts of high spatial resolution, i.e. turbine-tailored forecasts, to inform several operational decisions at the turbine level. Towards that, this paper is concerned with leveraging the hub-height measurements collected from a fleet of turbines on a farm to make turbine-specific short-term wind speed and power predictions. We find that the wind propagation across a dense grid of turbines induces strong spatial and temporal dependencies in the within-farm wind field, but also gives rise to high-frequency high-magnitude fluctuations which may compromise the predictive accuracy of several data-driven forecasting methods. To capture both aspects, we propose to model the total variability in the within-farm wind speed field as a combination of two independent stochastic process terms. The first term reconstructs and extrapolates the wind speed field by learning the complex spatio-temporal dependence structure using hub-height turbine-level data. The second term accounts for high-frequency high-magnitude fluctuations that are not informed by near-term spatio-temporal dependencies. The two terms are coupled to make probabilistic wind speed forecasts at each turbine, which are then translated into turbine-specific power predictions via wind power curves. Evaluation on more than 3,000,000 data points from a wind farm dataset provides a strong empirical evidence in favor of the proposed method’s forecasting accuracy. On average, our proposed method achieves 9\% accuracy improvement relative to persistence forecasts, and 7–9\% relative to a set of widely recognized forecasting methods such as autoregressive-based models and Gaussian Processes.},

In this paper, a data-driven multi-model wind forecasting methodology is developed with a two-layer ensemble machine learning technique. The first layer is composed of multiple machine learning models that generate individual forecasts. A deep feature selection framework is developed to determine the most suitable inputs to the first layer machine learning models. Then, a blending algorithm is applied in the second layer to create an ensemble of the forecasts produced by first layer models and generate both deterministic and probabilistic forecasts. This two-layer model seeks to utilize the statistically different characteristics of each machine learning algorithm. A number of machine learning algorithms are selected and compared in both layers. This developed multi-model wind forecasting methodology is compared to several benchmarks. The effectiveness of the proposed methodology is evaluated to provide 1-hour-ahead wind speed forecasting at seven locations of the Surface Radiation network. Numerical results show that comparing to the single-algorithm models, the developed multi-model framework with deep feature selection procedure has improved the forecasting accuracy by up to 30\%.},

	abstract = {Accurate wind speed prediction plays a vital role in power system in terms of rational dispatching and safe operation. For this purpose, a novel composite framework integrating time varying filter-based empirical mode decomposition ({TVF}-{EMD}), fuzzy entropy ({FE}) theory, singular spectrum analysis ({SSA}), phase space reconstruction ({PSR}), compound prediction models adopting kernel-based extreme learning machine ({KELM}) and convolutional long short-term memory network ({ConvLSTM}) as well as mutation and hierarchy-based hybrid optimization algorithm, is proposed in this paper. Among the supplementary strategies, {TVF}-{EMD}, {FE} and {SSA} are employed to achieve non-stationary raw series attenuation, aggregation for approximate {IMFs} as well as separation of dominant and residuary ingredients from the aggregated {IMFs}, respectively. Besides, parameters of {PSR} and {KELM} as well as wrapper method-based feature selection ({FS}) for input combination are synchronously optimized by the newly developed swarm optimizer integrating Harris hawks optimization ({HHO}) and grey wolf optimizer ({GWO}) with mutation operator and hierarchy strategy. Meanwhile, such hybrid structure is adopted to predict the preprocessed high-frequency components, while the remaining component is predicted by {ConvLSTM} cells-based deep learning network. Subsequently, the ultimate forecasting results of the raw wind speed are calculated by superimposing the predicted values of all components. Four datasets collected from various sites with two different time intervals and nine relevant contrastive models are carried out to evaluate the proposed approach, where the corresponding results demonstrate that: (1) data preprocessing strategy applying {TVF}-{EMD} and {FE} theory can significantly reduce the time consumption of the entire model without decreasing forecasting performance; (2) {SSA}-based dominant ingredients extraction can further improve the forecasting capability of combined model; (3) the proposed {MHHOGWO} can synchronously accomplish parameters optimization and {FS} effectively, thus improving the forecasting effectiveness of the entire model significantly; (4) the proposed compound prediction models based on {KELM} and {ConvLSTM} can exert the capabilities of each model adequately as well as ulteriorly reducing computational requirements.},

	abstract = {Accurate forecasting of wind power generation plays a key role in improving the operation and management of a power system network and thereby its reliability and security. However, predicting wind power is complex due to the existence of high non-linearity in wind speed that eventually relies on prevailing weather conditions. In this paper, a novel hybrid deep learning model is proposed to improve the prediction accuracy of very short-term wind power generation for the Bodangora wind farm located in New South Wales, Australia. The hybrid model consists of convolutional layers, gated recurrent unit ({GRU}) layers and a fully connected neural network. The convolutional layers have the ability to automatically learn complex features from raw data while the {GRU} layers are capable of directly learning multiple parallel sequences of input data. The data sets of 5-min intervals from the wind farm are used in case studies to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model against other advanced existing models, including long short-term memory, {GRU}, autoregressive integrated moving average and support vector machine, which are tuned to optimise outcome. To further evaluate the efficacy of the proposed model, another data set taken from the Capital wind farm in Australia is used. It is observed that the hybrid deep learning model exhibits superior performance in both the data sets over other forecasting models to improve the accuracy of wind power forecasting, numerically for the Bodangora wind farm, up to 1.59 per cent in mean absolute error, 3.73 per cent in root mean square error and 8.13 per cent in mean absolute percentage error.},

	abstract = {Wind speed forecasting is a crucial issue in the wind power industry. However, the disadvantage of the existing wind speed forecasting models is that they often ignore similar fluctuation information between the adjacent {WTGs} (wind turbine generators), which leads to poor forecasting accuracy. This paper proposes a hybrid wind speed forecasting model to overcome this disadvantage. Specifically, grey correlation analysis is applied to select useful fluctuation information from the adjacent and observed {WTGs}, and the chosen fluctuation information is fed into the v-{SVM} (v-support vector machine), which offers good capability in nonlinear fitting, to perform wind speed forecasting of the observed {WTGs}. Meanwhile, to reduce the impacts of the model parameters on the final forecasting performance, {CS} (cuckoo search) is used to tune the parameters in the v-{SVM}. The results from two case studies show that the proposed model, which considers the fluctuation information of the adjacent {WTG}, offers greater accuracy than the other compared models. As concluded from the results of three accuracy tests, the performances of v-{SVM} and ε-{SVM} (ε-support vector machine) show no significant difference, and the {CS} algorithm is more efficient than the {PSO} (particle swarm optimization) for tuning of the parameters in the v-{SVM}.},

However, the intermittent and stochastic nature of wind speed makes this task challenging. Artificial neural networks ({ANNs}) are widely used in this area; however, they may fail to provide the accuracy that may be required. This is due to applying shallow architectures with error-prone hand-engineered features. This paper proposes a deep neural network ({DNN}) architecture with stacked autoencoder ({SAE}) and stacked denoising autoencoder ({SDAE}) for ultrashort-term and short-term wind speed forecasting. Autoencoders ({AEs}) are applied for unsupervised feature learning from the unlabeled wind data and a supervised regression layer is applied at the top of the {AEs} for wind speed forecasting. Several uncertain factors exist in the wind data that degrade the accuracy of current methodologies. In order to improve the accuracy, rough neural networks are incorporated in the proposed deep learning models to develop novel rough extensions of {SAE} and {SDAE} that are robust to wind uncertainties. Experimental results show that the proposed rough {DNN} models outperform classic {DNNs} and previous models that apply shallow architectures in the view of lower {RMSE} and mean absolute error measurements.},

In this paper, a graph deep learning model is proposed to learn the powerful spatio-temporal features from the wind speed and wind direction data in neighboring wind farms. The underlying wind farms are modeled by an undirected graph, where each node corresponds to a wind site. For each node, temporal features are extracted using a long short-term memory Network. A scalable graph convolutional deep learning architecture ({GCDLA}), motivated by the localized first-order approximation of spectral graph convolutions, leverages the extracted temporal features to forecast the wind-speed time series of the whole graph nodes. The proposed {GCDLA} captures spatial wind features as well as deep temporal features of the wind data at each wind site. To further improve the prediction accuracy and capture robust latent representations, the rough set theory is incorporated with the proposed graph deep network by introducing upper and lower bound parameter approximations in the model. Simulation results show the advantages of capturing deep spatial and temporal interval features in the proposed framework compared to the state-of-the-art deep learning models as well as shallow architectures in the recent literature.},

	abstract = {Wind speed forecasting has been growing in popularity, owing to the increased demand for wind power electricity generation and developments in wind energy competitiveness. Many forecasting methods have been broadly employed to forecast short-term wind speed for wind that is irregular, nonlinear, and non-stationary. However, they neglect the effectiveness of data preprocessing and model parameter optimization, thereby posing an enormous challenge for the precise and stable forecasting of wind speed and the safe operation of the wind power industry. To overcome these challenges and further enhance wind speed forecasting performance and stability, a forecasting system is developed based on a data pretreatment strategy, a modified multi-objective optimization algorithm, and several forecasting models. More specifically, a data pretreatment strategy is executed to determine the dominating trend of a wind speed series, and to control the interference of noise. The multi-objective optimization algorithm can help acquire more satisfactory forecasting precision and stability. The multiple forecasting models are integrated to construct a combined model for wind speed forecasting. To verify the properties of the developed forecasting system, wind speed data of 10 min from 4 adjacent wind farms in Shandong Peninsula, China are adopted as case studies. The results of the point forecasting and interval forecasting reveal that our forecasting system positively exceeds all contrastive models in respect to forecasting precision and stability. Thus, our developed system is extremely useful for enhancing prediction precision, and is a reasonable and valid tool for intelligent grid programming.},

	abstract = {Wind speed forecasting plays a pivotal role in power dispatching and normal operations of power grids. However, it is both a difficult and challenging problem to achieve high-precision forecasting for the wind speed because the original sequence includes many nonlinear stochastic signals. The current conventional forecasting methods are more suitable for capturing linear trends, and artificial neural networks easily fall into a local optimum. This paper proposes a model that combines a denoising method with a dynamic fuzzy neural network to address the problems above. Singular spectrum analysis optimized by brain storm optimization is applied to preprocess the original wind speed data to obtain a smoother sequence, and a generalized dynamic fuzzy neural network is utilized to perform the forecasting. With a smaller and simpler structure of the neural network, the model can effectively achieve a rapid learning rate and accurate forecasting. Three experimental results, which cover 10-min, 30-min and 60-min interval wind speed time series data, demonstrate that the model can both satisfactorily approximates the actual value and be used as an effective and simple tool for the planning of smart grids.},

Vector autoregression ({VAR}) is a framework that has been shown to be well suited to predicting for several wind farms simultaneously by considering the spatio-temporal dependencies in their time series. Lasso penalisation yields sparse models and can avoid overfitting the large numbers of coefficients in higher dimensional settings. However, estimation in {VAR} models usually does not account for changes in the spatio-temporal wind power dynamics that are related to factors such as seasons or wind farm setup changes, for example. This paper tackles this problem by proposing a time-adaptive lasso estimator and an efficient coordinate descent algorithm for updating the {VAR} model parameters recursively online. The approach shows good abilities to track changes in the multivariate time series dynamics on simulated data. Furthermore, in two case studies it shows clearly better predictive performances than the non-adaptive lasso {VAR} and univariate autoregression.},

We first predicted the temporal dimension of wind speed at one-hour time interval, as a short-term wind speed prediction, in three wind observation stations ({WOSs}) in Iran. In the next part, estimation of wind speed data in a {WOS} using data from some other nearby {WOSs} was carried out. Due to the limitation of data collection, two groups of {WOSs} were selected for this target. The average value of the wind speed histogram error obtained from the best model in both groups is about 2.6\% which is certainly promising. In Iran, the scarcity of meteorological data has resulted in the limited study of wind energy resources. Therefore, this type of spatial prediction is very useful in wind resource assessment in the Iranian wind energy industry. This is a valuable tool that enables the decision maker to precisely detect the high wind speed areas over an entire region in the first step of investigation.},

This study addresses the complex control in systems based on wind energies by proposing a tool that is able to predict future wind power density in the near future, specifically, the next 10 min, allowing microgrid's control to be optimized. The tool is validated by examining the root mean square error value of the prediction. The deviation between the actual and forecasted wind power density was less than 6\% for 81\% of the examined days in the validation step, from January 2017 to August 2017.

	abstract = {Very short-term forecasts of wind power provide electricity market participants with extremely valuable information, especially in power systems with high penetration of wind energy. In very short-term horizons, statistical methods based on historical data are frequently used. This paper explores the use of dual-Doppler radar observations of wind speed and direction to derive five-minute ahead deterministic and probabilistic forecasts of wind power. An advection-based technique is introduced, which estimates the predictive densities of wind speed at the target wind turbine. In a case study, the proposed methodology is used to forecast the power generated by seven turbines in the North Sea with a temporal resolution of one minute. The radar-based forecast outperforms the persistence and climatology benchmarks in terms of overall forecasting skill. Results indicate that when a large spatial coverage of the inflow of the wind turbine is available, the proposed methodology is also able to generate reliable density forecasts. Future perspectives on the application of Doppler radar observations for very short-term wind power forecasting are discussed in this paper.},

	abstract = {Due to the economic and environmental benefits, wind power is becoming one of the more promising supplements for electric power generation. However, the uncertainty exhibited in wind power data is generally unacceptably large. Thus, the data should be accurately evaluated by operators to effectively mitigate the risks of wind power on power system operations. Recognizing this challenge, a novel deep learning based ensemble approach is proposed for probabilistic wind power forecasting. In this approach, an advanced point forecasting method is originally proposed based on wavelet transform and convolutional neural network. Wavelet transform is used to decompose the raw wind power data into different frequencies. The nonlinear features in each frequency that are used to improve the forecast accuracy are later effectively learned by the convolutional neural network. The uncertainties in wind power data, i.e., the model misspecification and data noise, are separately identified thereafter. Consequently, the probabilistic distribution of wind power data can be statistically formulated. The proposed ensemble approach has been extensively assessed using real wind farm data from China, and the results demonstrate that the uncertainties in wind power data can be better learned using the proposed approach and that a competitive performance is obtained.},

In previous studies, most forecasting models have focused on improving the accuracy or stability of wind speed forecasting. However, for an effective forecasting model, considering only one criterion (accuracy or stability) is insufficient. In this paper, a novel combined forecasting model was proposed and successfully employed to solve the problem of simultaneously obtaining both high accuracy and strong stability in wind speed forecasting. The proposed model consists of four {ANNs} (artificial neural networks) with optimum weight coefficients based on {MOBA} (multi-objective bat algorithm). {MOBA} overcomes the defect that only one criterion can be achieved by single objective optimization algorithms. In addition, data decomposition and de-noising are also incorporated in the data pre-processing stage. Ten-minute wind speed data from three datasets in Penglai, China, were selected for multi-step ahead forecasting to evaluate the effectiveness of the developed combined model. The experimental results indicate that the combined model outperforms other comparison models for generating forecasts in terms of forecasting accuracy and stability.},

	abstract = {The demand for minute-scale forecasts of wind power is continuously increasing with the growing penetration of renewable energy into the power grid, as grid operators need to ensure grid stability in the presence of variable power generation. For this reason, {IEA} Wind Tasks 32 and 36 together organized a workshop on “Very Short-Term Forecasting of Wind Power” in 2018 to discuss different approaches for the implementation of minute-scale forecasts into the power industry. {IEA} Wind is an international platform for the research community and industry. Task 32 tries to identify and mitigate barriers to the use of lidars in wind energy applications, while {IEA} Wind Task 36 focuses on improving the value of wind energy forecasts to the wind energy industry. The workshop identified three applications that need minute-scale forecasts: (1) wind turbine and wind farm control, (2) power grid balancing, (3) energy trading and ancillary services. The forecasting horizons for these applications range from around 1 s for turbine control to 60 min for energy market and grid control applications. The methods that can be applied to generate minute-scale forecasts rely on upstream data from remote sensing devices such as scanning lidars or radars, or are based on point measurements from met masts, turbines or profiling remote sensing devices. Upstream data needs to be propagated with advection models and point measurements can either be used in statistical time series models or assimilated into physical models. All methods have advantages but also shortcomings. The workshop’s main conclusions were that there is a need for further investigations into the minute-scale forecasting methods for different use cases, and a cross-disciplinary exchange of different method experts should be established. Additionally, more efforts should be directed towards enhancing quality and reliability of the input measurement data.},

In view of its importance, numerous wind speed forecasts have been proposed, each with advantages and disadvantages. Searching for more effective wind speed forecasts in wind energy management is a challenging task. As proposed, combined models have desirable forecasting abilities for wind speed. This paper reviewed the combined models for wind speed predictions and classified the combined wind speed forecasting approaches. To further study the combined models, two combination models, the no negative constraint theory ({NNCT}) combination model and the artificial intelligence algorithm combination model, are proposed. The hourly average wind speed data of three wind turbines in the Chengde region of China are used to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed combination models, and the results show that the proposed combination models can always provide desirable forecasting results compared to the existing traditional combination models.},

A short-term wind power prediction model based on physical approach and spatial correlation is proposed to characterize the uncertainty and dependence structure of wind turbines' outputs in the wind farm. Firstly, continuous partial differential equation of each wind turbine has been developed according to its specific spatial location and the layout of its neighboring correlated wind turbines. Then, spatial correlation matrix of wind speed is derived by discretizing differential equation at each wind turbine using a finite volume method ({FVM}). Wind speed at each turbine is acquired by solving the relevant differential equation under given boundary conditions. Finally, the wind speed is converted to wind power production via a practical power curve model. Prediction results showed that the spatial correlation model can accurately characterize the correlations among outputs of wind turbines and reduce the error of short-term wind power prediction.},

	abstract = {The inherent instability of wind power production leads to critical problems for smooth power generation from wind turbines, which then requires an accurate forecast of wind power. In this study, an effective short term wind power prediction methodology is presented, which uses an intelligent ensemble regressor that comprises Artificial Neural Networks and Genetic Programming. In contrast to existing series based combination of wind power predictors, whereby the error or variation in the leading predictor is propagated down the stream to the next predictors, the proposed intelligent ensemble predictor avoids this shortcoming by introducing Genetical Programming based semi-stochastic combination of neural networks. It is observed that the decision of the individual base regressors may vary due to the frequent and inherent fluctuations in the atmospheric conditions and thus meteorological properties. The novelty of the reported work lies in creating ensemble to generate an intelligent, collective and robust decision space and thereby avoiding large errors due to the sensitivity of the individual wind predictors. The proposed ensemble based regressor, Genetic Programming based ensemble of Artificial Neural Networks, has been implemented and tested on data taken from five different wind farms located in Europe. Obtained numerical results of the proposed model in terms of various error measures are compared with the recent artificial intelligence based strategies to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed scheme. Average root mean squared error of the proposed model for five wind farms is 0.117575.},

	abstract = {Wind energy, which is stochastic and intermittent by nature, has a significant influence on power system operation, power grid security and market economics. Precise and reliable wind speed prediction is vital for wind farm planning and operational planning for power grids. To improve wind speed forecasting accuracy, a large number of forecasting approaches have been proposed; however, these models typically do not account for the importance of data preprocessing and are limited by the use of individual models. In this paper, a novel combined model – combining complete ensemble empirical mode decomposition adaptive noise ({CEEMDAN}), flower pollination algorithm with chaotic local search ({CLSFPA}), five neural networks and no negative constraint theory ({NNCT}) – is proposed for short-term wind speed forecasting. First, a recent {CEEMDAN} is employed to divide the original wind speed data into a finite set of {IMF} components, and then a combined model, based on {NNCT}, is proposed for forecasting each decomposition signal. To improve the forecasting capacity of the combined model, a modified flower pollination algorithm ({FPA}) with chaotic local search ({CLS}) is proposed and employed to determine the optimal weight coefficients of the combined model, and the final prediction values were obtained by reconstructing the refined series. To evaluate the forecasting ability of the proposed combined model, 15-min wind speed data from four wind farms in the eastern coastal areas of China are used. The experimental results of this study show that: (a) the proposed {CEEMDAN}-combined model can take advantages of individual models and has the best performance among single models and the benchmark model; (b) the proposed {CLSFPA} is superior to {FPA} according to test functions and is effectively applied in optimizing the combined model; (c) the proposed algorithms are effective in high-precision wind speed predictions.},

	abstract = {Reliable wind speed forecasting is essential for wind power integration in wind power generation system. The purpose of paper is to develop a novel hybrid model for short-term wind speed forecasting and demonstrates its efficiency. In the proposed model, a compound structure of extreme learning machine ({ELM}) based on feature selection and parameter optimization using hybrid backtracking search algorithm ({HBSA}) is employed as the predictor. The real-valued {BSA} ({RBSA}) is exploited to search for the optimal combination of weights and bias of {ELM} while the binary-valued {BSA} ({BBSA}) is exploited as a feature selection method applying on the candidate inputs predefined by partial autocorrelation function ({PACF}) values to reconstruct the input-matrix. Due to the volatility and randomness of wind speed signal, an optimized variational mode decomposition ({OVMD}) is employed to eliminate the redundant noises. The parameters of the proposed {OVMD} are determined according to the center frequencies of the decomposed modes and the residual evaluation index ({REI}). The wind speed signal is decomposed into a few modes via {OVMD}. The aggregation of the forecasting results of these modes constructs the final forecasting result of the proposed model. The proposed hybrid model has been applied on the mean half-hour wind speed observation data from two wind farms in Inner Mongolia, China and 10-min wind speed data from the Sotavento Galicia wind farm are studied as an additional case. Parallel experiments have been designed to compare with the proposed model. Results obtained from this study indicate that the proposed hybrid model can provide an effective modeling approach to capture the nonlinear characteristics of wind speed signal and thus providing more satisfactory forecasting results.},

However, in practice, wind farm operators are usually unwilling to share their private data with each other because of competitive reasons and security considerations. To address this issue, this paper presents how wind power probabilistic forecasting using off-site information could be achieved in a privacy-preserving and distributed fashion. Wind power probabilistic forecasts are created by means of multiple quantile regression. The original large-scale forecasting problem is first decomposed into a large number of small-scale subproblems. The subproblem can be computed locally on each farm. Then, the closed-form solution to the subproblem is derived exactly for achieving high computational efficiency. The proposed approach offers a flexible framework for using off-site information, but without having to exchange commercially sensitive data among all participants. It relies on the alternating direction method of multipliers algorithm to achieve the cooperation among all participants and finally converges to the optimal solution. Case studies with real-world data validate improvements in the forecast accuracy when considering spatio-temporal correlations. Distributed approaches also show higher computational efficiency than traditional centralized approaches.},

The purpose of this study is to develop a novel model for wind speed causality processing and short-term wind speed forecasting. In this study, the hybrid model combining causality processing strategy called “decomposition- virtual nodes-pruning” and Long Short-Term Memory Network based on Neighborhood Gates is proposed to obtain high-precision wind speed predictions. First, Pearson Correlation Coefficient, Maximal Information Coefficient and Granger causality test are used to explore the correlation and causality between wind speed and meteorological factors. Then, the causality is divided into five categories: center, chained, ring, tree and network causality, according to the topological structure of causality. Next, all types of causality can be unified into an equivalent tree causality by the causality processing strategy. Afterward, Long Short-Term Memory Network based on Neighborhood Gates is proposed to dynamically adjust the network structure according to the specific equivalent tree causality. Finally, the performance of the proposed model is verified by eight models from three aspects with different features, different methods and different equivalent trees in the case in Fuyun meteorological station, Xinjiang province, China. The evaluation metrics of the prediction results obtained by the proposed model are optimal among the eight models.

	abstract = {Wind energy has received more and more attention around the world since it is a kind of clean, economical and renewable energy. However, the strong randomness of the wind speed makes wind power difficult to integrate into the power grid. Obtaining reliable high-quality wind speed prediction results is very important for the planning and application of wind energy. In this study, Shared Weight Long Short-Term Memory Network ({SWLSTM}) is proposed to decrease the number of variables that need to be optimized and the training time of Long Short-Term Memory Network ({LSTM}) without significantly reducing prediction accuracy. Furthermore, a new hybrid model combined {SWLSTM} and {GPR}, called {SWLSTM}-{GPR}, is proposed to obtain reliable wind speed probabilistic prediction result. {SWLSTM}-{GPR} is applied to four wind speed prediction cases in Inner Mongolia, China and compared with the state-of-the-art wind speed prediction methods from four aspects: point prediction accuracy, interval prediction suitability, probability prediction comprehensive performance and training time. The reliability test of {SWLSTM}-{GPR} guarantees that the prediction results are reliable and convincing. The experimental results show that {SWLSTM}-{GPR} can obtain high-precision point prediction, appropriate prediction interval and reliable probabilistic prediction results with shorter training time on the wind speed prediction problems.},

	abstract = {The ever-increasing number of wind farms has brought both challenges and opportunities in the development of wind power forecasting techniques to take advantage of interdependencies between tens or hundreds of spatially distributed wind farms, e.g., over a region. In this paper, a sparsity-controlled vector autoregressive ({SC}-{VAR}) model is introduced to obtain sparse model structures in a spatio-temporal wind power forecasting framework by reformulating the original {VAR} model into a constrained mixed integer nonlinear programming ({MINLP}) problem. It allows controlling the sparsity of the coefficient matrices in direct manner. However this original {SC}-{VAR} is difficult to implement due to its complicated constraints and the lack of guidelines for setting its parameters. To reduce the complexity of this {MINLP} and to make it possible to incorporate prior expert knowledge to benefit model building and forecasting, the original {SC}-{VAR} is modified and a correlation-constrained {SC}-{VAR} ({CCSC}-{VAR}) is proposed based on spatial correlation information about wind farms. Our approach is evaluated based on a case study of very-short-term forecasting for 25 wind farms in Denmark. Comparison is performed with a set of traditional local methods and spatio-temporal methods. The results obtained show the proposed {CCSC}-{VAR} has better overall performance than both the original {SC}-{VAR} and other benchmark methods, taking into account all evaluation indicators, including sparsity-control ability, sparsity, accuracy, and efficiency.},

	abstract = {Forecasts of available wind power are critical in key electric power systems operations planning problems, including economic dispatch and unit commitment. Such forecasts are necessarily uncertain, limiting the reliability and cost-effectiveness of operations planning models based on a single deterministic or “point” forecast. A common approach to address this limitation involves the use of a number of probabilistic scenarios, each specifying a possible trajectory of wind power production, with associated probability. We present and analyze a novel method for generating probabilistic wind power scenarios, leveraging available historical information in the form of forecasted and corresponding observed wind power time series. We estimate nonparametric forecast error densities, specifically using epi-spline basis functions, allowing us to capture the skewed and nonparametric nature of error densities observed in real-world data. We then describe a method to generate probabilistic scenarios from these basis functions that allows users to control for the degree to which extreme errors are captured. We compare the performance of our approach to the current state-of-the-art considering publicly available data associated with the Bonneville Power Administration, analyzing aggregate production of a number of wind farms over a large geographic region. Finally, we discuss the advantages of our approach in the context of specific power systems operations planning problems: stochastic unit commitment and economic dispatch. Our methodology is embodied in the joint Sandia–University of California Davis Prescient software package for assessing and analyzing stochastic operations strategies.},

	abstract = {Optimizing thermal generation commitments and dispatch in the presence of high penetrations of renewable resources such as solar energy requires a characterization of their stochastic properties. In this paper, we describe novel methods designed to create day-ahead, wide-area probabilistic solar power scenarios based only on historical forecasts and associated observations of solar power production. Each scenario represents a possible trajectory for solar power in next-day operations with an associated probability computed by algorithms that use historical forecast errors. Scenarios are created by segmentation of historic data, fitting non-parametric error distributions using epi-splines, and then computing specific quantiles from these distributions. Additionally, we address the challenge of establishing an upper bound on solar power output. Our specific application driver is for use in stochastic variants of core power systems operations optimization problems, e.g., unit commitment and economic dispatch. These problems require as input a range of possible future realizations of renewables production. However, the utility of such probabilistic scenarios extends to other contexts, e.g., operator and trader situational awareness. We compare the performance of our approach to a recently proposed method based on quantile regression, and demonstrate that our method performs comparably to this approach in terms of two widely used methods for assessing the quality of probabilistic scenarios: the Energy score and the Variogram score.},

	abstract = {Short-term (up to 2–3 days ahead) probabilistic forecasts of wind power provide forecast users with highly valuable information on the uncertainty of expected wind generation. Whatever the type of these probabilistic forecasts, they are produced on a per horizon basis, and hence do not inform on the development of the forecast uncertainty through forecast series. However, this additional information may be paramount for a large class of time-dependent and multistage decision-making problems, e.g. optimal operation of combined wind-storage systems or multiple-market trading with different gate closures. This issue is addressed here by describing a method that permits the generation of statistical scenarios of short-term wind generation that accounts for both the interdependence structure of prediction errors and the predictive distributions of wind power production. The method is based on the conversion of series of prediction errors to a multivariate Gaussian random variable, the interdependence structure of which can then be summarized by a unique covariance matrix. Such matrix is recursively estimated in order to accommodate long-term variations in the prediction error characteristics. The quality and interest of the methodology are demonstrated with an application to the test case of a multi-{MW} wind farm over a period of more than 2 years.
